# My Shell Configs

This Repo is a Collection of bash configurations, shortcuts and scripts that I prefer
to use on the command line. Sets up Prompt to display useful information and adds a
few useful aliases.

If you are unfamiliar with navigating and running programs via the
command line, I recommend:
