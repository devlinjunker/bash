# Collection of Bash Scripts

A small group of bash scripts I've written

## bvimrc

## directoryLoop.sh
Example of how to loop over a directory and subdirectory performing a command at each level

## gitstatus
Script for getting a simplified git status message. Used in the  bash prompt.  

[ ] Fix commit behind/ahead number  
[ ] Remove status from my_profile so consistent

## lsgit
TODO: Display Current directory file git status in ls output

## max
Gets the max value between two numbers
