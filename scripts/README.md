# Collection of Bash Scripts

A small group of bash scripts I've written

## bvimrc
Creates a vimrc file with specific settings that I like. Currently only my tab settings and to ensure line numbers are shown.

## ec2ssh
Quick script to ssh into server with a private encryption key, changes the terminal profile when on the server and returns it to the state before the ssh once finished.

[ ] Currently set to the Eduworks Key from the ec2 website. Change EC2 Key  
[ ] Default vs parameter key  
[ ] Different Terminal settings for different servers  
[ ] Default upload bash server settings once created  

## gitstatus
Script for getting a simplified git status message. Used in the  bash prompt.  

[ ] Fix commit behind/ahead number  
[ ] Remove status from my_profile so consistent

## max
Gets the max value between two numbers
