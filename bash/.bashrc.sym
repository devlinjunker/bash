# TODO: research .bashrc vs .bash_profile
#  - .bash_profile won't be picked up on switching to bash from other shell, need .bashrc for this
#  - How does this work for servers?
#  - for window computers and others...?

## read universal bash profile
[[ -e ~/.bash_profile ]] && source ~/.bash_profile

## make sure admin commands are on path??
export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin
